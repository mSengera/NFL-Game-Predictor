# [Machine learning] NFL-Game-Predictor
To get some practice in machine learning, I trying to solve the prediction of an NFL Game with machine learning.

I use the NFL Game API (https://api.nfl.com/docs/getting-started/index.html) for the underlaying data.

To prevent reengineering the whole nflgame data collection, I used following PyPi Project:
- https://pypi.org/project/nflgame/

Thanks to that really nice api conenctor @BruntShishi! (https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame)

Special thanks to @mlenzen to port the nflgame extension to Python3! (https://github.com/mlenzen/nflgame)
